Our lab’s research focuses on elucidating how memory is 
encoded, retained, and retrieved within neural networks and molecules in the brain. 
We employ and develop cutting-edge tools to record and manipulate neuronal and molecular activities to unravel these mysteries.
Our approach is integrative, expanding from electrophysiology, imaging, behavior, genetic manipulations, omics, to computational modeling.

## Elucidating neural networks supporting memory encoding and consolidation

Much of our work focuses on the hippocampus, a brain region giving rise to neural sequences underlying episodic memory. 
These sequences, occurring during either behavior (theta sequences) or sleep (replay sequences), make the foundation of memory encoding and consolidation. 
We believe what drives these sequences is a brain-wide oscillation network, and our lab is elucidating the key nodes in this network and how information is transmitted among them.
One recent focus of the lab is an understudied hypothalamic structure in the brain’s oscillation network, the supramammillary nucleus. Unique about this small subcortical nucleus is its broad, extensive connections to the hippocampus and cortex. We are investigating how these long-range bottom-up pathways modulate network dynamics to process memory and cognition.
See how we identified the supramammillary nucleus as a hypothalamic novelty hub and how it modulates different types of memories in the hippocampus.

## Deciphering neural computation underlying memory-guided behavior

Complex cognitive activities, such as planning and thinking, rely on established knowledge about the external world. 
We believe that the design of elaborate behavioral tasks, combined with large-scale in vivo recordings of neural activity, can lead to new discoveries about the underlying neural computations.
Our lab employs this approach to investigate how the brain synthesizes novel ideas and solutions from stored information – i.e. memory retrieval and utilization. By drawing inspiration from psychology, engineering, and computer sciences, we aim to dissect neural mechanisms underlying memory-guided complex behaviors.

## Developing next-generation noninvasive brain machine interfaces for memory and cognitive control

Manipulating memory and cognition requires technologies to spatiotemporally modulate nervous systems in deep tissue, sometimes in a precision closed-loop manner. 
For decades, physicians have utilized implanted electrodes connected through wires to a pacemaker-like device under the skin of the chest to electrically stimulate neurons deep in the brain. 
This approach, known as deep brain stimulation, has proved to be effective, but is costly, highly invasive, and lacks cell specificity.
Our lab is developing noninvasive, high-precision neuromodulation technologies to manipulate diverse deep structures in the nervous system that are conventionally hard to reach. 
We adopt a cross-disciplinary approach by designing and synthesizing molecularly engineered, noninvasively delivered nano- or micro-interfaces capable of converting tissue-penetrable stimuli into signals sensible by genetically defined brain cells. We believe such efforts will contribute to the field’s collective efforts in unlocking diverse routes towards next-generation, noninvasive neuromodulation therapies.
See how we developed and showcased a minimally invasive technology, near-infrared upconversion optogenetics, for various neuromodulation applications, e.g. recalling a stored memory by transcranial near-infrared light.

## Linking molecular and network pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no cure for AD, and clinical trials only provide modest benefits.
While characterized by pathological molecules like amyloid-β, tau and APOE4, AD is a mental and cognitive disorder. 
How the molecular pathologies lead to cognitive decline remains elusive. Bridging this gap requires understanding neural circuit mechanisms. 
By taking advantage of our expertise in systems neuroscience, our lab is identifying circuit pathology and developing circuit-targeting therapies for AD.
See how we demonstrated the efficacy of a peptide drug that rescues cognitive decline and synaptic function in an animal model of advanced-stage AD.
