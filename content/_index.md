[//]: # (## - About Us -)

[//]: # (Large-scale datasets have fueled recent advancements in AI-based autonomous vehicle research. )

[//]: # (However, these datasets are usually collected from a single vehicle's one-time pass of a certain location, lacking multiagent interactions or repeated traversals of the same place. )

[//]: # (Such information could lead to transformative enhancements in autonomous vehicles' perception, prediction, and planning capabilities. )

[//]: # (To bridge this gap, in collaboration with the self-driving company May Mobility, we present the MARS dataset which unifies scenarios that enable MultiAgent, multitraveRSal, and multimodal autonomous vehicle research. )

[//]: # (More specifically, MARS is collected with a fleet of autonomous vehicles driving within a certain geographical area. )

[//]: # (Each vehicle has its own route and different vehicles may appear at nearby locations. )

[//]: # (Each vehicle is equipped with a LiDAR and surround-view RGB cameras. )

[//]: # (We curate two subsets in MARS: one facilitates collaborative driving with multiple vehicles simultaneously present at the same location, and the other enables memory retrospection through asynchronous traversals of the same location by multiple vehicles. )

[//]: # (We conduct experiments in place recognition and neural reconstruction. )

[//]: # (More importantly, MARS introduces new research opportunities and challenges such as multitraversal 3D reconstruction, multiagent perception, and unsupervised object discovery.)

Some treasured life experiences, such as the first step onto college campus or the first glimpse of
a loved one, can remain etched in our memories for a lifetime. Where and how different
memories – an episode of life experience or a concept about a person – reside in the brain
remains a mystery. We are intrigued by long-standing questions such as:

- How do neural networks encode and store episodic and semantic information?
- How is stored information retrieved and utilized to support cognitive processes like
planning and thinking?
- What molecules underpin memory processes, especially memory storage?

If these mechanisms are deciphered, we might be able to read and manipulate memories, such as
enhancing memory and cognition in Alzheimer&#39;s disease and erasing traumatic memories
associated with PTSD.
